Sometimes Senator Sofen simply sat in his office wondering, for full minutes at a time, how he'd possibly gotten there. He was smack in the middle of one such reverie this past Thursday, a light sweat starting to slick his skin, when his secretary floated agitatedly down to him through the North America-shaped hole in his office ceiling.

As she crossed the room to descend towards him, she briefly blotted out clusters of stars whose location Sofen kept synced to the real time plot of a directed graph of his constituents' progress in the flow network -- an organic oozing punctuated by sudden surges around constellations of newly valuable keyword clusters. On his better days, the stars' movement pulled Sofen towards a zen state not unlike watching exotic fish silently iridesce in a thick-walled tank. Today, however, it reminded him of nothing more than an exploding mass of fiery asteroids crashing down on his head, like Chicken Little's most gothic nightmare.
