Grand Central Station

  The teal stone starfield loomed into view as Chalk strode the last few stairs into the station's grand concourse. He straightened up underneath the arch and a twinge shot through his right knee. He wobbled and held his breath, silently begging the Joint Judge for just a few more hours' reprieve.
  He probably deserved the mutiny, he knew. Between coaching his son's Padded Jogging team on alternate Sundays and the seventeen extra stairs (each way, he reminded himself; it adds up) introduced by his new commute ever since the transfer his daily millimeters of cartilage stretch must regularly exceed his knee's repair capacity.
  And that meant injury. And injury never went unnoticed.
  Chalk started across the concourse, joining the flow of foot traffic behind a broad-backed man whose multi-colored patchwork pseudo-leather coat stretched out enormous across his field of vision.
  They walked past tunnels to trains, the glowing, gold-framed signs above their doors calling out departures for Toronto and Austin.
  There was something wrong with the man's gait, Chalk realized. He lurched as if his legs were changing length beneath him. And his head lolled forward on his neck, loose and rubbery.
  Chalk had never seen anything like it. He felt his pulse increase and his face flush with the faster-moving blood.
  As they approached the lines of people radiating out from the information kiosk at the center of the huge room, the man's lurches took him left, keeping him directly in Chalk's path to the ticket counter.
  Suddenly, the jacket moved.
  Chalk saw it distinctly. On the upper right of the man's back, as if an arm had tried to reach out from a part of the jacket with no arm hole, a solid fist shape had pressed out, distorting the jacket's patchwork, then receded.
  The man stood up sharply like he'd just heard his own name shouted across the concourse and Chalk had to pull up short to avoid walking straight into him, his face stopping just inches from an electric blue square of pseudo-leather.
  Before Chalk could do more than take a tentative step back, the man's hand shot up to his side, wrapping around his body in an awkward half-hug, his fingers groping at the ribs beneath his shoulder blade.
  It moved again. This time Chalk was close enough to hear it: a thump like a ball hitting a safety tarp.
  The man grunted audibly, the sound rose to an almost porcine squeal seeming to stick in his nasal passages. He hit the ground so fast it looked to Chalk like a stutter in a piece of streaming video.
  Without thinking Chalk rushed up and knelt at his side. Right as he reached him, the man's body arched violently, the force flipping him over onto his back. The landing knocked a grunt of breath out of him that wafted up towards Chalk, tunneling its way into his nasal passages and forcing him to yank his head back as if he'd been burned, his eyes watering.
  When Chuck's vision cleared, he saw that the side of the man's coat was squirming violently. Something was trapped in there and it was trying desperately to wriggle its way free.
  Then, he saw it. A thumb-shaped reddish-purple protrusion, glistening wetly up from the crevice of the man's armpit.
  It looked around. It didn't have eyes, but there was really no other way to describe the motion. The thing swiveled side-to-side like a prairie dog checking for predators before scampering across a plain. For a moment, it seemed to see him, to look straight at him.
  It darted forward, the head leaning down to wedge its way between the man's arm and his body, a wet ooze of mucus smearing on the coat at the contact points. It squeezed free. Its body, a triangular mass the size of a football, followed the head onto the pale tile floor. It looked dense like a slab of meat in a grocer's glass case.
  The thing shook itself, its sides shuddering, splattering drops of its mucus onto the tile and prone man. When it moved its bottom edge seemed to blur where it met the floor.
  Finally, the protuberance swiveled away from Chalk's face. It pointed itself east towards the entrance to the concourse and scurried off, picking up a surprising amount of speed. Twenty feet away, it swerved around a startled woman in a big fuzzy pink coat, under a double-wide stroller, around the information kiosk and out of view.
  Chalk stared after its receding mucus trail for a few beats before his thundering pulse quieted enough for the fallen man's guttural groans to register.
  He turned back to the man. Cautiously avoiding the could of astringent breath gathered around the man's face, Chalk leaned in. His moans had become mumbles.
  "Fucking tender," he thought he heard. "'Sbecome like...," he trailed off.
  Chalk risked a turn towards the man's face. His big cheeks were alarmingly ruddy and his eyes seemed to focus in different directions.
  Chalk grabbed his shoulder and shook, trying to keep him conscious. The man squealed as his back ground against the floor and his eyes opened alertly.
  "The liver was it?"
  Hardly a slur in his voice.
  "Tell Philly--" he broke off, his eyes briefly distant again.
  He started fidgeting.
  "Back itches something awful. Will you, uh...check back there?"
  He looked sideways, just over Chalk's left ear.
  "Is there a lot of blood?"
  Chalk hesitated a second and then reached his hand around the man's side. He patted down the coat and the tile floor but found only a thin slick residue of mucus. This was tinted pink, but hardly a pool of blood.
  "Doesn't seem much," he said. "Lift up."
  Haltingly, the man wedged himself onto one elbow, twisting his back off the tile. Chalk rearranged his legs so he could lean over to get a better look, hunting for a mucus-free patch of tile to plant his hand.
  Near the middle of the jacket, under the man's right shoulder blade, a frayed hole punched through the pseudo-leather.
  Chalk rolled over onto and got his knees under him, freeing his left hand. As he leaned past, the man who watched him intently, squinted eyes revealing more interest than fear. Gingerly, he pulled back the flaps of the hole to expose the wound, craning around to see.
  Only the wound wasn't there. There was only a smooth hairless expanse of back, edge by gnarled clumps of skin and sprayed with a fine pink mist of mucus.
  The station swiveled wildly around him and then Chalk heard his head hit the tile with a hollow thunk. After a second, the glowing clocks above the information kiosk swam into view, preternaturally sharp against the dimming background. As the concourse's light foxed in around their incandescent faces, Chalk realized: he was going to miss his train.
  

  After:
  being debriefed downstairs in the food court near the chyron store
  what is the food like? 
  policeman needs to get information across:
  - what happened
  - insurance company policy etc
  armed soldier types moving through the food court
  
  
  Final scene of arriving at home:
  
  what does Chalk do?
  where is he commuting to?
  what is the suburb like?
  
  maybe his knee revolts at home? something with the kids?
