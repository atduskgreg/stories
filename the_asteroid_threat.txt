It was eighteen months they'd spent now, trapped in this tiny tin can pinned to a frozen rock the size of a Colorado suburb by a thousand mile wick of fire on the edge of human-accessible space.

One night, there it'd been in the middle of the light-smeared southland sky. The lab that'd found it -- little more than amateurs, really -- was run by a former astronaut third-stringer, washed out with an earlier undetected injury after just one flight. He was a 'roid nut, so, of course, they had the chicken little problem: it wasn't their first atmosphere-incinerating, ocean-boiling, ice age-inducing world-ender.

It took a late night phone call, strings pulled with the clink of scotch-soaked ice in a heavy-bottomed glass as accompaniment, to get the astronaut in front of a series of lecture halls filled with more sober scientists where he could cajole them into getting their telescopes pointed at the right patch of night sky.

A certain tentative panic started to take hold.


The American's name was Butch. Butch Malik. Born Francis, but changed it early because he knew astronauts always have names like washed-up high school football stars or someone's beloved mutt.
