The intimate smell of hot toner pursued them as Dog continued, "There's no docs, no spec -- god, not even -- no tests."

The Map had been acting up lately and Dog couldn't believe he was showing it to her. Come to that, he couldn't believe she was in his unit. Or anyone was.

The fussy hand-planed built-ins densely packed with sedimented layers of commodity media storage. The stacks of cheap translucent plastic drawers infested with colonies of cables and adapters. The shelves of old books, stacked three deep, exhaling the dank breath of moldy pages and shedding spines (waiting for the Reader).
